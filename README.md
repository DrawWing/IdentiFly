IdentiFly is a software for semi-automatic classification based on
geometric morphometrics. Primarily developed for the identification of
insect species, it can also be used for the classification of other
objects that differ in shape. IdentiFly can also be used as an
alternative to tpsDig for digitizing landmarks and semilandmarks in two
dimensions. At the moment it is mainly used for the identification of
honey bee subspecies and lineages.
